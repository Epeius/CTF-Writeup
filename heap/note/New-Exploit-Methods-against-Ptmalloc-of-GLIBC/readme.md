# New Exploit Methods against Ptmalloc of GLIBC

The code and content is obtained from [New Exploit Methods against Ptmalloc of GLIBC](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7847004/)

This repo is the note I made while read through the paper and run the examples with GDB.

To compile as the example on the paper, we can

```C++
gcc *.c -fpie -pie
```

From the paper: 

The object V represents the vulnerable object and
the object T represents the hypothesized target object. We
prove the success of attack by corrupting the contents of T.
